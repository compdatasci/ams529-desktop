Welcome to the Docker image for AMS 529: Finite Element Methods!
This image is based on Ubuntu 18.04, with FEniCS 2019.1.0, SciPy and
Spyder for Python 3.6.3, Jupyter Notebook, and g++-7.2 preinstalled.

To explore FEniCS, checkout the demo programs in the '~/fenics-demo' directory.
For example:

    cd ~/fenics-demo/documented/poisson/python/
    python3 demo_poisson.py

Please save your code and data into the ~/shared or ~/project directories.
The former maps to the current work directory on your computer. The latter
maps to the Docker data volume named ams529_project on your host.

To use git with ssh authentication, make sure the ssh key on your host
computer is in bitbucket and github, and then run "ssh-add" in this terminal
to add your ssh key to the ssh-agent.

Happy computing!
