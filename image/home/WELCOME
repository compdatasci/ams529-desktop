Welcome to the Docker image for AMS 529: Finite Element Methods!

This image is based on Ubuntu 16.04, with FEniCS, SciPy and Spyder for
Python 3.5, Jupyter Notebook, and g++-5.4 preinstalled.

Please save your code and data into the ~/shared or ~/project directories.
The former maps to the current work directory on your computer. The latter
maps to the Docker data volume named ams529_project on your host.

To use git with ssh authentication, make sure the ssh key on your host
computer is in bitbucket and github, and then run "ssh-add" in this terminal
to add your ssh key to the ssh-agent.

Happy computing!
